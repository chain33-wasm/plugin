   /**
    *  An action is performed by an actor, aka an account. It may
    *  be created explicitly and authorized by signatures or might be
    *  generated implicitly by executing application code.
    *
    *  This follows the design pattern of React Flux where actions are
    *  named and then dispatched to one or more action handlers (aka stores).
    *  In the context of eosio, every action is dispatched to the handler defined
    *  by account 'scope' and function 'name', but the default handler may also
    *  forward the action to any number of additional handlers. Any application
    *  can write a handler for "scope::name" that will get executed if and only if
    *  this action is forwarded to that application.
    *
    *  Each action may require the permission of specific actors. Actors can define
    *  any number of permission levels. The actors and their respective permission
    *  levels are declared on the action and validated independently of the executing
    *  application code. An application code will check to see if the required authorization
    *  were properly declared when it executes.
